Hi, I'm Henry. You're currently reading a markdown document fetched and then rendered inside of a Custom WebGL "operating system". 

I was going to make a portfolio website, but I think this does a better job at hinting at what I like to do - design low level systems. Well, in this case, it isn't super low level.
